**Sprint 2 Planning Notes:**

**Things to do better:**
1. more comments/docmentation
    - Sprintboot does a ton for us, still important to understand
2. report personal progress better (slack)
3. write more tests, plan better to complete tasks first that other tasks depend on
    - comments on issues
4. meet once more during the week

**Must Dos:**
- Skeleton of CI/CD testing pipeline
- Unit tests
- At least one added working feature in walking skeleton
    - Demonstrable feature that involves integration of front-end with back-end
- At least one functional front-end screen with full implementation of the visual design
- All DB tables created (per ERD or other design doc)

**Notes:**
- CI/CD pipelining skeleton by end of sprint, someone should understand this well (High priority)
- tables, shoes table should be created, action log and shipment log needs to be initialized as well
