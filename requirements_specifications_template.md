# Requirements and Specification Document

## TeamName

<!--The name of your team.-->

### Project Abstract

<!--A one paragraph summary of what the software will do.-->

This is an example paragraph written in markdown. You can use *italics*, **bold**, and other formatting options. You can also <u>use inline html</u> to format your text. The example sections included in this document are not necessarily all the sections you will want, and it is possible that you won't use all the one's provided. It is your responsibility to create a document that adequately conveys all the information about your project specifications and requirements.

Please view this file's source to see `<!--comments-->` with guidance on how you might use the different sections of this document. 

### Customer

<!--A brief description of the customer for this software, both in general (the population who might eventually use such a system) and specifically for this document (the customer(s) who informed this document). Every project will have a customer from the CS506 instructional staff. Requirements should not be derived simply from discussion among team members. Ideally your customer should not only talk to you about requirements but also be excited later in the semester to use the system.-->

### User Requirements

<!--This section lists the behavior that the users see. This information needs to be presented in a logical, organized fashion. It is most helpful if this section is organized in outline form: a bullet list of major topics (e.g., one for each kind of user, or each major piece of system functionality) each with some number of subtopics.-->

Here is a user requirements sample from [Crookshanks](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.library.wisc.edu/library/view/practical-software-development/9781484206201/9781484206218_Ch02.xhtml):

| ID   | Description                                                  | Priority | Status |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | ------ |
| R11  | Users should not have to sign into the system; their current network login should be used for identification. | Med      | Done   |
| R12  | The user should pick a project first; the tasks available are a derivative of the project. | High     | Open   |
| R13  | A full-time employee should not be able to submit a time card with less than 40 hours per week recorded. | High     | Open   |
| R14  | A contractor can submit any number of hours up to 60 without special approval. | Med      | Open   |
| R15  | A team lead can see his/her team's time cards before they are submitted but cannot approve them until the user submits it. | High     | Open   |

### Use Cases & User Stories

<!--Use cases and user stories that support the user requirements in the previous section. The use cases should be based off user stories. Every major scenario should be represented by a use case, and every use case should say something not already illustrated by the other use cases. Diagrams (such as sequence charts) are encouraged. Ask the customer what are the most important use cases to implement by the deadline. You can have a total ordering, or mark use cases with “must have,” “useful,” or “optional.” For each use case you may list one or more concrete acceptance tests (concrete scenarios that the customer will try to see if the use case is implemented).-->

Here is a sample user story from [Clean Agile](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.library.wisc.edu/library/view/clean-agile-back/9780135782002/ch03.xhtml#ch03lev1sec1) using a markdown block quote:

> As the driver of a car, in order to increase my velocity, I will press my foot harder on the accelerator pedal.

### User Interface Requirements

<!--Describes any customer user interface requirements including graphical user interface requirements as well as data exchange format requirements. This also should include necessary reporting and other forms of human readable input and output. This should focus on how the feature or product and user interact to create the desired workflow. Describing your intended interface as “easy” or “intuitive” will get you nowhere unless it is accompanied by details.-->

<!--NOTE: Please include illustrations or screenshots of what your user interface would look like -- even if they’re rough -- and interleave it with your description.-->

Images can be included with `![alt_text](image_path)`

### Security Requirements

<!--Discuss what security requirements are necessary and why. Are there privacy or confidentiality issues? Is your system vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks?-->

### System Requirements

<!--List here all of the external entities, other than users, on which your system will depend. For example, if your system inter-operates with sendmail, or if you will depend on Apache for the web server, or if you must target both Unix and Windows, list those requirements here. List also memory requirements, performance/speed requirements, data capacity requirements, if applicable.-->

### Specification

<!--A detailed specification of the system. UML, or other diagrams, such as finite automata, or other appropriate specification formalisms, are encouraged over natural language.-->

<!--Include sections, for example, illustrating the database architecture (with, for example, an ERD).-->

<!--Included below are some sample diagrams, including some example tech stack diagrams.-->

You can make headings at different levels by writing `# Heading` with the number of `#` corresponding to the heading level (e.g. `## h2`).

#### Technology Stack

Here are some sample technology stacks that you can use for inspiration:
