# Security Requirements for StockSync Inventory Management System

## 1. Authentication and Authorization
SR1.1: The system must implement secure authentication mechanisms for all users, requiring a username and a strong password. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) should be supported and encouraged for enhanced security.
SR1.2: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure users have access only to the functionalities relevant to their role within the organization. At least the roles of Administrator, Manager, and Employee must be defined with clear permissions.
## 2. Data Encryption
SR2.1: All sensitive data, including personal user information and inventory data, must be encrypted at rest using industry-standard encryption algorithms.
SR2.2: All data in transit between the client and server must be encrypted using TLS/SSL protocols to prevent data interception and eavesdropping.
## 3. Input Validation and Sanitization
SR3.1: The system must validate and sanitize all input data to prevent common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and command injection attacks.
## 4. Audit Logging and Monitoring
SR4.1: All user actions and system changes must be logged with sufficient detail, including timestamps, user identifiers, and the nature of the action. Logs must be stored securely and reviewed regularly for suspicious activity.
SR4.2: Implement real-time monitoring and alerting for potential security incidents or system anomalies.
## 5. Vulnerability Management
SR5.1: The system must undergo regular security assessments, including vulnerability scans and penetration testing, to identify and remediate potential security issues.
SR5.2: Apply patches and updates to the system components and dependencies in a timely manner to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
## 6. Data Backup and Recovery
SR6.1: Implement regular data backup procedures to protect against data loss. Backups should be encrypted and stored in a secure offsite location.
SR6.2: Develop and test a data recovery plan to ensure the system can be quickly restored in the event of a failure or data loss incident.
## 7. Privacy Compliance
SR7.1: Ensure the system complies with applicable data protection and privacy laws, such as GDPR or CCPA, including mechanisms for data access requests, data correction, and data deletion by users.
## 8. Session Management
SR8.1: Securely manage user sessions, implementing timeout policies and protecting session tokens against hijacking. Use secure, HTTPOnly cookies for session management.
## 9. Access Control
SR9.1: Implement strict access control measures for both physical and digital assets. Ensure that only authorized personnel can access the system infrastructure and data centers.
## 10. Secure Development Practices
SR10.1: Adhere to secure coding practices and guidelines throughout the development process. Conduct code reviews with a security focus to identify and fix security flaws.
