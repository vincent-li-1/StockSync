# Coding Standards

## 1. Limited Use of Globals
- Define which types of data can be declared globally and which cannot.

## 2. Standard Headers for Different Modules
- **Name of the module**
- **Date of module creation**
- **Author of the module**
- **Modification history**
- **Synopsis**
- **Functions supported**: List with input and output parameters.
- **Global variables**: Accessed or modified by the module.

## 3. Naming Conventions
- **Local Variables**: Use camel case (e.g., `localData`).
- **Global Variables**: Start with a capital letter (e.g., `GlobalData`).
- **Constants**: Use all capital letters (e.g., `CONSDATA`).
- **Functions**: Use camel case starting with a small letter.

## 4. Indentation
- Use spaces after commas between function arguments.
- Indent nested blocks properly.
- Start all braces on a new line.

## 5. Error Return Values and Exception Handling Conventions
- Functions should return 0 or 1 to indicate failure or success.

## 6. General Coding Guidelines
- Avoid complex coding styles.
- Use meaningful names for identifiers.
- Document the code properly with comments.
- Keep functions short and focused.
- Avoid using GOTO statements.

## Advantages of Coding Guidelines
- Increase software efficiency and reduce development time.
- Help in early error detection to reduce costs.
- Improve code readability and maintainability.
- Reduce the hidden costs of software development.
